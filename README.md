# plant watering system

## Introduction
My project is to create a watering system which waters plant as soil becames dry.

## components used
1. arduino uno
2. soilmoisture sensor
3. water pump
4. 9v battery
5. electromagnetic relay
6. breadboard

## explanation 
first the soilmoisture sensor will give voltage as output depending on moisture of soil(high for dry sand and low for moisture soil). then if it says soil is dry then water pump is turn on to water plants for 1s and after 2s moisture is again checked and it continues to water till soil is dry(not upto the mark for vegetation).
